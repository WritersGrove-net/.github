# Code of Ethics

## 1. User-Centric Commitment

We believe that you, the user, are our customerâ€”not the product. This principle guides all of our decisions and ensures that your rights and privacy are always prioritized.

## 2. Transparency and Control

- **Data Ownership**: You own your content. We only request the right to display it on our site. You have full control over your data, with the ability to delete it at any time. Deleted data will be permanently removed from our servers after a 30-day grace period.
- **Privacy Protection**: We will not sell your information to third parties. We use privacy-focused tools like Plausible.io for analytics and only collect the minimum information necessary to operate our services.

## 3. Ethical Use of Technology

- **No AI Training Without Consent**: We will not use your data to train AI without your explicit consent. If we ever decide to involve user data in AI training, it will be strictly opt-in, and participating users will be compensated.

## 4. Freedom of Expression with Responsibility

- **Content Moderation**: We respect your right to share your stories and content freely. We only intervene in specific circumstances, such as legal obligations or threats to our business model. Our moderation is minimal but necessary to maintain a safe and legal environment.

## 5. Commitment to Privacy

- **No Selling of User Information**: We respect your privacy and will never sell your information to third parties. Ads may be displayed on the content of free users to support our platform financially, but we do so without compromising your privacy.

## 6. Legal Compliance and Jurisdiction

- **Adherence to Applicable Laws**: We comply with applicable US laws, particularly those of Michigan. Our services are not designed for use in the EU or UK, and we do not recognize their jurisdiction. If you use our platform from these regions, you acknowledge that it is not designed to comply with local regulations.

## 7. Community Respect and Engagement

- **No Drama Policy**: We value a positive and respectful community. We will intervene in conflicts that disrupt the harmony of our community, with a clear process for warnings and bans if necessary. Hate speech, harassment, and discrimination will not be tolerated.

## 8. Ethical Business Practices

- **Fair Revenue Model**: We aim to run a sustainable business that supports our small team without resorting to unethical practices. Our revenue comes from ads and paid services, not from exploiting user data.
